AB Testing with Shoefly

AB Testing with Shoefly is the second project in the CodeAcademy Pandas Library lesson: "Aggregating with Pandas". Although it was a very comprehensive guide to Pandas
There were a lot of things that I wish I knew (Refer to the reflections file in this repository). Aside from what I wish I knew, here is a comprehensive summary of 
this project.

S.T.A.R

Scenario - You are a data analyst for ShoeFly, a company that sells a variety of shoes. Both the Product Management team and the Data Analytics team needs to come up
with aggregated data to support findings and implement the best strategies for each of the different products

Task - Aggregate the data from the dataframe ad_clicks to help support your findings and report to your MDs successfully

Action - There is a step by step guide and an additional walkthrough video to help aid you through this process

Result - Split testing with supported findings 


Problem: Although this was a nice project, especially for beginner programmers, it doesn't provide much value on a portfolio, especially if you're applying for 
data analytics. It's too cookie cutter, what sets you apart if anyone can pay $75 a year and get the same copied and pasted result. 

Solution: Diversify the project. Add your own elements, challenges and/or new insights that wasn't previously found in the step-by-step guide. 

Added elements: Personally for me it was hard to visualize the results of the aggregated data and calculating the metrics for the testing was even harder since I 
barely had a grip on communicating with the Pandas API. I used two tools in particular that helped me understand the project even further, and helped me understand 
what I did for each step: SQL & Tableau. Divide and Conquer: I divided Pandas tools into tools that I'm already familiar with to really help me understand the project
For data query and aggregation I used SQL, for data visualization I used Tableau. This resulted in understanding the conclusions that I came to and was able to generate
business insights from the data that was aggregated and queried.
