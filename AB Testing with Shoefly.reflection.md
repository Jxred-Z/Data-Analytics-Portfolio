After completing this project, there is definitely a lot of things that could have been done alternatively or ideas that I had to make the project more challenging/
different from the original project from CodeAcademy.

Alternatives: Instead of using Tableau for the visualizations, I could have used Matplotlib. I've thought of this before, and I could barely grasp concepts in
Matplotlib, and, for the sake of time, decided that Tableau would be a lot more effective and efficient for me to visualize because I am already familiar with it 
(instead of reading the documentation for a whole new library). I wouldn't say that this would be an effective or better change, it would just be an interesting
challenge and was a missed opportunity to gain more from the project. 

New Elements: Something that was suggested by a friend was to add a new element: Cost per Click. If we wanted to go into the financials of the project, we could 
define what are budget is, how much does it cost to run ad a as opposed to ad b, how much does it cost to run ad a as opposed to ad b over time, and how much would
be a realistic budget provided the circumstanced. I feel that with this new element as well as adding...
